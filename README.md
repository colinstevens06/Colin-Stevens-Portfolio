# Colin-Stevens-Portfolio

Thanks for checking out my ReadME. Since you're here, I know you place a value on development basics. That's important to me. I want to work with someone who places an emphasis on mastering the fundamentals, knowing that's how you form a strong foundation to become an outstanding developer and company.

This is the first website that I wrote from scratch during my coding bootcamp at Johns Hopkins University.

In this, we used some basic HTML and CSS code that we learned in the first week of class. It was fun to make!

I currently work as a web project manager at a local hospital, so I came into class already familiar with different HTML and CSS elements but had never written code from scratch on my own before. I mostly editi other people's code or writing very basic HTML and CSS into my web page's body copy.

I've also spent a lot of time over the past couple years looking at source code for my company's website and other websites, so I cam einto class with familiarity of overal structuring, but never actually writing it myself.

In writing a small site's code from scratch, I gained a greater appreciation for what goes into developing a website and the thought that goes into creating sleek, cohesive designs. I also found myself really enjoying thinking through the issues!

My favorite part to build was the custom grid on the portfolio page. I look forward to enhanving this section with Javascript and more CSS alterations in the future. I want it to feel more interactive, and would also want a more modern design.

I hope you enjoy exploring my portfolio. You can reach me at 301-908-2196 or colinstevens06@gmail.com
